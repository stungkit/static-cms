- **Name**: `gitlab`

You can use the `test-repo` backend to try out Static CMS without connecting to a Git repo. With this backend, you can write and publish content normally, but any changes will disappear when you reload the page. This backend powers the Static CMS [demo site](https://demo-staticjscms.netlify.app/).

**Note:** The `test-repo` backend cannot access your local file system, nor does it connect to a Git repo, thus you will not see any existing files while using it.

To enable this backend, set your backend name to `test-repo` in your Static CMS `config` file.

## Example

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
backend:
  name: test-repo
```

```js
backend: {
  name: 'test-repo',
},
```

</CodeTabs>
