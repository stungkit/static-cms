title: Configuration Options
weight: 10
---

All configuration options for Static CMS are specified in a `config.yml` file, in the folder where you access the editor UI (usually in the `/admin` folder).

Alternatively, you can specify a custom config file using a link tag:

```html
<!-- Note the "type" and "rel" attribute values, which are required. -->
<link href="path/to/config.yml" type="text/yaml" rel="cms-config-url" />
```

If you prefer, you can use a javascript file (`admin/config.js`) instead of a yaml file. Simply import the javascript config and pass it into your `CMS.init({ config })` call.

To see working configuration examples, you can [start from a template](/docs/start-with-a-template) or check out the [CMS demo site](https://demo-staticjscms.netlify.app/). (No login required: click the login button and Static CMS will open.) You can refer to the demo [configuration code](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms/blob/main/core/dev-test/config.yml) to see how each option was configured.

You can find details about all configuration options below. Note that [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Basic_components) allows lists and objects to be written in block or inline style, and the code samples below include a mix of both.

## Backend

_This setting is required._

The `backend` option specifies how to access the content for your site, including authentication. Full details and code samples can be found in [Backends](/docs/backends-overview).

**Note**: no matter where you access Static CMS — whether running locally, in a staging environment, or in your published site — it will always fetch and commit files in your hosted repository (for example, on GitHub), on the branch you configured in your Static CMS config file. This means that content fetched in the admin UI will match the content in the repository, which may be different from your locally running site. It also means that content saved using the admin UI will save directly to the hosted repository, even if you are running the UI locally or in staging. If you want to have your local CMS write to a local repository, [try the local_backend setting](/docs/local-backend).

### Commit Message Templates

You can customize the templates used by Static CMS to generate commit messages by setting the `commit_messages` option.

Template tags wrapped in curly braces will be expanded to include information about the file changed by the commit. For example, `{{path}}` will include the full path to the file changed.

#### Example

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
backend:
  commit_messages:
    create: Create {{collection}} "{{slug}}"
    update: Update {{collection}} "{{slug}}"
    delete: Delete {{collection}} "{{slug}}"
    uploadMedia: Upload "{{path}}"
    deleteMedia: Delete "{{path}}"
    openAuthoring: "{{message}}"
```

```js
backend: {
  commit_messages: {
    create: 'Create {{collection}} "{{slug}}"',
    update: 'Update {{collection}} "{{slug}}"',
    delete: 'Delete {{collection}} "{{slug}}"',
    uploadMedia: 'Upload "{{path}}"',
    deleteMedia: 'Delete "{{path}}"',
    openAuthoring: '"{{message}}"'
  },
},
```

</CodeTabs>

#### Commit Types

Static CMS generates the following commit types:

| Commit type   | When is it triggered?        | Available template tags                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`      | A new entry is created       | `slug`, `path`, `collection`, `author-login`, `author-name`, `fields` |
| `update`      | An existing entry is changed | `slug`, `path`, `collection`, `author-login`, `author-name`, `fields` |
| `delete`      | An existing entry is deleted | `slug`, `path`, `collection`, `author-login`, `author-name`           |
| `uploadMedia` | A media file is uploaded     | `path`, `author-login`, `author-name`                                 |
| `deleteMedia` | A media file is deleted      | `path`, `author-login`, `author-name`                                 |

#### Template Tags

Template tags produce the following output:

- `{{slug}}`: url-safe filename of the changed entry
- `{{collection}}`: name of the collection containing the changed entry
- `{{path}}`: full path to the changed file
- `{{author-login}}`: login/username of the author
- `{{author-name}}`: full name of the author (might be empty based on the user's profile)
- `{{fields.[FIELD_NAME]}}`: A custom fields value

## Publish Mode

By default, all entries created or edited in Static CMS are committed directly into the main repository branch.

The `publish_mode` option allows you to enable "Editorial Workflow" mode for more control over the content publishing phases. All unpublished entries will be arranged on a dashboard according to their status, and they can be further reviewed and edited before going live.

See [Editorial Workflow](/docs/editorial-workflow) for more information.

## Media and Public Folders

Static CMS users can upload files to your repository using the Media Gallery. The following settings specify where these files are saved, and where they can be accessed on your built site.

### Media Folder

_This setting is required._

The `media_folder` option specifies the folder path where uploaded files should be saved, relative to the base of the repo.

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
media_folder: "static/images/uploads"
```

```js
media_folder: 'static/images/uploads',
```

</CodeTabs>

### Public Folder

The `public_folder` option specifies the folder path where the files uploaded by the media library will be accessed, relative to the base of the built site. For fields controlled by \[file] or \[image] widgets, the value of the field is generated by prepending this path to the filename of the selected file. Defaults to the value of `media_folder`, with an opening `/` if one is not already included.

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
public_folder: "/images/uploads"
```

```js
public_folder: '/images/uploads',
```

</CodeTabs>

Based on the settings above, if a user used an image widget field called `avatar` to upload and select an image called `philosoraptor.png`, the image would be saved to the repository at `/static/images/uploads/philosoraptor.png`, and the `avatar` field for the file would be set to `/images/uploads/philosoraptor.png`.

This setting can be set to an absolute URL e.g. `https://netlify.com/media` should you wish, however in general this is not advisable as content should have relative paths to other content.

## Media Library

The `media_library` settings allows customization of the media library.

### Options

| Name                  | Type    | Default  | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| max_file_size         | number  | `512000` | _Optional_. The max size, in bytes, of files that can be uploaded to the media library |
| folder_support        | boolean | `false`  | _Optional_. Enables directory navigation and folder creation in your media library     |
| display_in_navigation | boolean | `true`   | _Optional_. Displays the "Media" link in the main navigation                           |

### Example

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
media_library:
  max_file_size: 512000
  folder_support: true
```

```js
{
  media_library: {
    max_file_size: 512000,
    folder_support: true
  }
}
```

</CodeTabs>

## Site URL

The `site_url` setting should provide a URL to your published site. May be used by Static CMS for various functionality. Used together with a collection's `preview_path` to create links to live content.

**Example:**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
site_url: https://your-site.com
```

```js
site_url: 'https://your-site.com',
```

</CodeTabs>

## Display URL

When the `display_url` setting is specified, the Static CMS UI will include a link in the fixed area at the top of the page, allowing content authors to easily return to your main site. The text of the link consists of the URL with the protocol portion (e.g., `https://your-site.com`).

Defaults to `site_url`.

**Example:**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
display_url: https://your-site.com
```

```js
display_url: 'https://your-site.com',
```

</CodeTabs>

## Custom Logo

When the `logo_url` setting is specified, the Static CMS UI will change the logo displayed at the top of the login page, allowing you to brand Static CMS with your own logo. `logo_url` is assumed to be a URL to an image file.
When the `logo_link` setting is specified, the Static CMS UI will wrap the logo in a link, allowing you to make the logo clickable. `logo_link` can be a URL to an external page or an address of one of Static CMS pages giving you a quick link to your favourite page.

**Example:**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
logo_url: https://your-site.com/images/logo.svg
logo_link: https://your-site.com
```

```js
logo_url: 'https://your-site.com/images/logo.svg',
logo_link: 'https://your-site.com',
```

</CodeTabs>

## Locale

Static CMS locale. Defaults to `en`.

**Example**

In your `config`:

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
locale: 'de'
```

```js
locale: 'de',
```

</CodeTabs>

When a translation for the selected locale is missing the English one will be used.

> All locales are registered by default (so you only need to update your `config`).

## Search

The search functionally requires loading all collection(s) entries, which can exhaust rate limits on large repositories. It can be disabled by setting the top level `search` property to `false`.

Defaults to `true`

**Example:**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
search: false
```

```js
search: false,
```

</CodeTabs>

## Slug Type

The `slug` option allows you to change how filenames for entries are created and sanitized. It also applies to filenames of media inserted via the default media library.\
For modifying the actual data in a slug, see the per-collection option below.

`slug` accepts multiple options:

- `encoding`

  - `unicode` (default): Sanitize filenames (slugs) according to [RFC3987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987) and the [WHATWG URL spec](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/). This spec allows non-ASCII (or non-Latin) characters to exist in URLs.
  - `ascii`: Sanitize filenames (slugs) according to [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). The only allowed characters are (0-9, a-z, A-Z, `_`, `-`, `~`).

- `clean_accents`: Set to `true` to remove diacritics from slug characters before sanitizing. This is often helpful when using `ascii` encoding.
- `sanitize_replacement`: The replacement string used to substitute unsafe characters, defaults to `-`.

**Example**

<CodeTabs>
```yaml
slug:
  encoding: "ascii"
  clean_accents: true
  sanitize_replacement: "_"
```

```js
slug: {
  encoding: 'ascii',
  clean_accents: true,
  sanitize_replacement: '_'
},
```

</CodeTabs>

## Collections

_This setting is required._

The `collections` setting is the heart of your Static CMS configuration, as it determines how content types and editor fields in the UI generate files and content in your repository. Each collection you configure displays in the left sidebar of the Content page of the editor UI, in the order they are entered into your Static CMS `config` file.

`collections` accepts a list of collection objects. See [Collections](/docs/collection-overview) for details.

## Disable Local Backup

When the `disable_local_backup` setting is set to `true` local backups will no be taken for your entries.

## YAML Options

The YAML format parsing and stringifing can be customized via the `yaml` setting. Available options can be found in the [yaml docs](https://eemeli.org/yaml/#options),

| Setting           | Docs                                        |
